I've been doing remote work with a professor on ML for brain modelling, and I figured the difference between Montreal and Toronto was the same as the difference between, say, Montreal and Jakarta.

I'll be working on deep learning for smarter cities, which means I'll have to learn 1. how to do deep learning and 2. how to do deep learning in Chinese.

People say that technology is light years ahead in China, so it would be helpful to find out now rather than later whether I should optimize my life for China's takeover of the world.

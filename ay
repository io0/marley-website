- Being a part of the data acquisition and analysis at the Youth Wellness Center inspired me to look for more scalable, automated ways of managing data. I am currently working on Machine Learning software for processing prenatal heart rate at Perigen. My experience in the clinical world provided valuable background for my work in healthcare technology.

Hi dad,

I hope you've been doing well. How is Graham? Can he speak full sentences yet?

I've been enjoying my summer so far. I'm working 9-5 most days but I try to go biking and spend time outdoors every weekend. Last weekend I went to Quebec City. I still have a foggy memory of the first time I went to Quebec City; I remember there were canons, and you or mom bought me ice cream.

I'm quite excited about the opportunities in Montreal and at McGill. I'm planning on working in a lab throughout the year to help pay for living expenses. I'm going to have to pay tuition quite soon--could you give me an update on the RESP?

Love,

Yaya
